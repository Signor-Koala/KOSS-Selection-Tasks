# Writing a simple Web Server with Rust!

Write a multithreaded web server that:
- Listens on a specified port (5000/8000)
- Has a single endpoint, that serves 1 HTML file, along with CSS and a JS script.
- Can handle upto 4 incoming connections at a time. 
- Has a counter that counts the number of visitors that have visited the site.



Explain in detail how Rust's borrow checker and type safety provides advantages for safety.

Explain all the crates you have used, and write a detailed README with build/run instructions. 

(Optional) Tell us how you could deploy this application using Docker. This is purely an optional component, and you could feel free to ignore
